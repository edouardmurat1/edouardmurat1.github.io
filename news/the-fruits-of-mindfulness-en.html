<h4>Here are my thoughts, here are my emotions, here are my feelings</h4>

<p>When a thought, emotion, or strong sensation is born in me, I can see it more clearly and promptly. These mental concepts become a practical reality that I live every day, rather than just a theory. <strong>And by observing what is happening in me, I act to reduce the difficulties that I find there.</strong> If anger rises in me, I see it and take a time alone more quickly and easily...which reduces reducing the rise of my anger. This is just a simple example of the thousands of experiences I see and feel every day...and that I now know how to appreciate more.</p>

<p>Thoughts and reflection reduce, leaving room for observation and simple appreciation of one's life. In our present society the reflection is the element that is put forward most, even if the reflection is not necessarily what helps us. To ruminate over and over the same difficulties, the same scenario in our head is far from useful.</p>

<p>Instead, through the practice of mindfulness we bring more calm and silence into our minds. <strong>The fog calms down and we can see that underneath finally...the sun is still there.</strong></p>

<h4>Reduction of anxiety</h4>

<p>It is a real epidemic that strikes us, that prevents us from moving while destroying our body and our ability to see clearly the situation in which we find ourselves. Even if one is suffering from another disease one can be happy and enjoy his life...but with anxiety it becomes much more than difficult.</p>

<p>Through the practice of mindfulness, we learn to stay more in the present without being caught up in our ideas of the past and the future. In the present, anxiety has no place, and <strong>to see how much my own anxiety has reduced is a great source of happiness on its own.</strong></p>

<p>Whether we imagine a future that is glorious or harmful, it's still our imagination...a filter on the reality in front of us. Practicing mindfulness allows you to stay rooted in reality...and reality is much more beautiful than we might imagine. It goes well beyond our simplistic imagination.</p>

<p>Without anxiety, each of our actions comes from a deeper motivation than fear and brings us much more satisfaction and joy...since it takes birth in a greater inner calm. <strong>Without anxiety, we can live our life more pleasantly and see many doors open before us.</strong></p>

<h4>Time is stretching</h4>

<p>Time is not as fixed as we imagine, since to be aware of the notion of time, we must be aware of the present moment...many times in our life. <strong>The notion of time depends enormously on our level of awareness of the present.</strong></p>

<p>Before my practice of mindfulness, <strong>I was aware of the present 1,000 times a day</strong> (for example) so for me to observe 1000 moments meant a completed day. If I was more aware of my day then I would say, "Wow, today was really a long day". After practicing mindfulness, <strong>I am now aware of the present 10 000 times a day</strong> (for example). For me a day now equals 10 days of my life before starting the practice.</p>

<p>My notion of time has grown, and this phenomenon alone involves a lot of changes in my life. It happens much less often for me to be stressed when thinking about tomorrow, next week...and next year? Hahaha, no way. It feels like 10 years from now, which is way too far for me to worry about it. Having more time is a perception, you think you do not have enough time to meditate, <strong>the good solution is then to ... meditate to save time.</strong></p>

<h4>More concentration, More understanding, more compassion</h4>

<p>The more useful faculties of our minds emerge when practicing daily. Focusing on a task at hand becomes much easier and gives me a lot more satisfaction than before.</p>

<p>Understanding the situation in which I live, that of others, and the multiple connections that connect each and every existence of this life get clearer and more present. I feel a stronger relationship between myself and others, and nurtures my sense of compassion with others and <strong>my body and mind come out lighter and more calm.</strong></p>

<p>Our mental faculties such as concentration or compassion already exist in us, but do not have a fixed size. By practicing mindfulness, these skills are trained, nurtured, and grow more and more, bringing with it great satisfaction.</p>

<h4>Go for it</h4>

<p>Do not hesitate to practice! Your fears, doubts, and questions will calm down from the moment you put into practice what you read on mindfulness. <strong>Reading without practicing is like being a spoon in a soup...being surrounded by the teachings of mindfulness without ever being able to taste it.</strong> Practice at home or in a group, but practice.</p>

<h4>Our services</h4>

<p>At HeadPause, we have a <strong><a href="https://www.headpause.com/services/meditation-group-en.html">free meditation group</a></strong> every Friday, during which you can practice mindfulness with us and see the fruits of your practice grow.
