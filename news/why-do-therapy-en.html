                <p>We all have great potential in life, but many obstacles might come in the way of our biggest aspirations. Whether it comes in the forms of fears, traumas, anxieties or disorders, <strong>we can overcome them and come out stronger at the other end with the simple use of therapy.</strong> Here are some reasons for why you should give therapy a try.</p>

<h4>Being completely honest</h4>

<p>Our families and friends are closer to us than anyone else on this planet, yet we don’t necessarily trust them with all <strong>our deepest secrets</strong>. They have expectations of us, and it is difficult sometimes to share our problems openly with them. When talking to a therapist, we can share our struggles and try out, in this new relationship, to <strong>be as honest as possible </strong>for once. Such an importunity comes very handy and gives you a chance to come clean in a <strong>safe and compassionate environment</strong>, with a person that cares for you and understands that secrets become heavier and heavier with time. To let go of your deepest secrets will really remove a ton of weight on your shoulders, <strong>a weight that is currently keeping you down.</strong></p>

<h4>Get out of the negative loop</h4>

<p>Having negative thoughts and feelings is a growing norm of our society, but it is clearly <strong>not the way we should keep living our life.</strong> Life is beautiful and full of promises, when we start to get out of the negative loop. The cycle of negative thoughts and feelings can be broken more easily when our therapist looks at it with us, when we try to figure out what’s happening together. All mental problems can be changed and reduced as long as we decide to <strong>seek help and trust the knowledge of others</strong>, your therapist will guide you toward ways that will break the negative cycle once and for all.</p>

<h4>Find a solution</h4>

<p>You have a specific problem that you find difficult to share with your family or friends, and <strong>can’t seem to find solutions on your own...It’s normal.</strong> We are social people and function best in groups and societies, that is how we usually deal with problems and find better solutions...when we work on it together. <strong>Talk to a therapist to get an external perspective on your problems.</strong> This will help you see other aspects of your problem, view it more realistically and openly, and discover new solutions that you were not able to come up with on your own.</p>

<h4>Make life brighter</h4>

<p>Life is beautiful, a true miracle, and can be full of joy and happiness. All you need is a little bit of help to understand what is happening in your lives, and transform your experience into a much more enjoyable one. With the help of a therapist, you can <strong>discover new ways to improve your life</strong>, follow your goals, and increase your happiness. It is up to you to give it a try, to trust in the fact that life can be so much more when you start opening up to someone else.</p>

<h4>Accomplish your dreams</h4>

<p>We all have beautiful dreams. Maybe you want to feel more fulfilled by your work, to have better relationships or to simply be more happy. You don’t have to give up on your dreams but instead <strong>see a therapist and find concrete ways to follow them.</strong> With some help, it is possible to walk the path of your dreams while maintaining a stable way of life. By writing down some goals with your therapist, following their progress together, and having <strong>a helping hand with you along the way</strong>, this big hike of yours might become a lot easier.</p>

<h4>Our services</h4>

<p>If you want to try out therapy in a comfortable way, just ask for a <strong><a href="/services/home-therapy-en.html">free session of home therapy</a></strong> given by <strong><a href="/team/edouard-murat-en.html">Edouard</a></strong>. He’ll make sure that you feel comfortable, understood and that you get clear positive changes in your life.</p>
