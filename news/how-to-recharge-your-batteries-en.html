                <p class="lead mb-0">“<em>Sometimes I need to go off on my own. I am not sad. I am not angry. I am just recharging my batteries.</em>” - Kristen Butler</p>

<p>This is a message to all of you out there that put a lot of effort in accepting, forgiving, loving and helping others...even if you use your energy for the common good, you have a limited amount to spend in a day without damaging your own bodies and minds. In this article, I’ll enumerate <strong>a couple of ways to recharge your batteries when they are depleted</strong> by your generous efforts.</p>

<h4>Sleep</h4>

<p>There is no better way to recover energy than sleep. If you are seriously lacking it, don’t bother reading any further and go lie down. If you have difficulty sleeping than do the following exercise: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Lie down</li>
  <li>Close your eyes</li>
  <li>Follow your breathing</li>
  <li>When your mind wanders, go back to your breath</li>
  <li>After 10 minutes, let go of focus and let your mind do whatever it wants</li>
</ul>

<h4>Know Your Limits</h4>

<p>First of all, you need to take the time to know yourself and your own limits. Normally, sleep would be the ultimate way to recharge your batteries, but if you overdo it then there will be left-over fatigue. Many people tend to over-help others, forgetting their own bodies and therefore falling into depression, burnout, sickness, etc.</p>

<p>If you get sick, then others will have to help you out and make sure you get back on your feet again...therefore it is a good idea to know your limits, and help in accordance to your own resources.</p>

<p>And a great way to know who you are and what you can and cannot do...is to spend some time alone</p>

<h4>Spend Time Alone</h4>

<p>I meditate every morning, it is my favorite way to fill up my batteries and get ready for the whole day that is in front of me, while learning myself and life. If I want to help others when they are present, then I need to help myself when I am alone.</p>

<p>Waking up early is a major help, because most people are in a zombie-like mode and won’t ask for your help much when the sun rises. There is a good reason for why we say that waking up early is important, and to me it is a clear time to learn how I function and enter a good level of relaxation.</p>

<p>If you spend a lot of time with others, yet think a lot about yourself during that time...it probably means you lack that alone-time and therefore really need it. Your body needs your help and tells you so by literally having your attention come to your body and mind again and again. If it is your case, go away from the group and take 10-30 minutes alone...they’ll manage without you.</p>

<h4>Use Personal Time Wisely</h4>

<p>Instead of filling up your precious alone time with passing desires such as snacking, watching TV and gaming, use some of it to relax your body and mind. Any activity that requires less or no movement (yoga), less attention switching (painting), less thinking (listening to instrumental music), and less past/future visualization (mindfulness) will do. Try to have some time (10-30 min) every day, to do such an activity. It is probably missing in your life and that is why you are on the verge of shutting down.</p>

<h4>Say No</h4>

<p>I would love to have the capacity and energy to say yes to everyone that asks for my help...by I can’t because I’m human and limited. If I did, I would not survive a whole week and probably no one would. While being said “no” to is painful, if what was asked of you is too much of a pain, just be honest and say out loud that you are tired...others will adjust to you when they know how you feel.</p>

<h4>Ask help</h4>

<p>We live in communities and families, rather than alone, for a reason. We are supposed to ask help when times are tough, rely on others when we get sick...that’s okay, normal and expected. If you help others during the rest of the day, don’t worry, someone will come to your help when you ask for it.</p>

<p>Again, taking some time to recuperate your energy is not selfish and stupid but rather smart and helpful for you can be of much better use when you are in a right state of body and mind. You are as important as anybody else, and deserve help as much as anyone when you are struggling.</p>

<h4>Our services</h4>

<p>At HeadPause, we organize a <a href="/services/meditation-group-en.html"><strong>free weekly meditation group</strong></a> each Friday, where you can recharge your batteries and learn how to do that on your own as well. Also, we have a 2h <a href="/services/mindfulness-workshop-en.html"><strong>mindfulness workshop</strong></a> coming up <strong>this Thursday</strong> to introduce you to the practice of mindfulness, which is very helpful in our “thinking-focused” society.</p>
