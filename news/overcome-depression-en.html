This is sad to hear, but don't despair yet...for <strong>our lives can change for the better and what it requires to change is...more wisdom.</strong></p>
<p>This article is dedicated to a friend of mine undergoing the battle of depression as we speak, I hope that what I share today will help him out as well as others in the fight.</p>

<h4>Knowledge is not Wisdom</h4>

<p>We all want to change and be more happy, there is no denying that, but how do we do that? To find out how, we read many articles, books, facebook posts, inspirational quotes, and listen to videos, conferences...we try to acquire all the information out there that can help us.</p>
<p>That is a natural response and <strong>while we acquire more knowledge, we do not acquire more wisdom.</strong> Wisdom is not only the accumulation of information but a learning that is like a touching or smelling, and is much more deep and meaningful. Any information that increases our wisdom has a deep impact on us and leads to real change. <strong>This is what we need to fight depression</strong>, not mere pieces of information in articles, but true wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom can only be acquired through practice.</strong> I'm sorry to be so blunt, but this is just true. Without practice there cannot be any real change to your situation, you can read as much as you want, as long as it stays just information, not much will change inside.</p>

<h4>Skills to overcome Depression</h4>

<p>You've probably read about depression before, but just in case you haven't... here is how it works. <strong>Depression comes from the accumulation and cycle of negative thoughts inside our brains.</strong> That cycle, if not kept under check, can go on for quite some time and do a lot of damage to us. This is where change can happen...in our thoughts. Therefore to get over depression there is only one way to go...to <strong>look at your thoughts.</strong></p>
<p>You might say "Well thanks a lot Edouard...for nothing, if I could do that than I would have a long time ago"...well this is where it gets more complex. If you are depressed, it already means that you have a difficult time to look at your thoughts and accept them, but instead are better at avoid them and repress them...and it is how it is. This is who you are, right now, unable to look at what is bringing you so much pain. <strong>So, we have to use a slightly different approach!</strong></p>
<p>Today, let's look at simple ways for you to overcome depression over the next months. Now, remember that it takes time and practice to change those annoying thoughts of yours, so be patient and keep at it. Here are the steps that I recommend to you if you suffer from depression, do them in the order specified.</p>

<h4>Work to do</h4>

</br>
<h6>1- Be more honest!</h6>
<p>Show that you are depressed, don't force a smile when you don't feel like it. Make the effort to <strong>let it show in your face and in the way you talk.</strong> Let others take on some of the burden that you are desperately trying to lift on your own. When someone asks you "how are you doing?" <strong>be strong and tell them the truth</strong>, that you are depressed and that life can be difficult for you. If you do so...people will understand you, be nicer to you and try to help you out. You don't have to support all this depression on your shoulders, share it with others, that's why we live together. By being more honest about depression, <strong>you will start to have more energy and motivation to do the practice you need to change.</strong></p>

<h6>2- Do 10 to 20 minutes of breathing meditation everyday, not less, not more.</h6>
<p>By doing this daily, you will start to<strong> observe your thoughts instead of reacting to them.</strong> Negative thoughts will reduce, hurt you less, and let you live life finally instead of surviving it. Replace another activity that you are currently doing with meditation instead. Meditation is crucial for you and key to the change you seek. Do <a href="/services/try-meditation-en.html"><strong>this exercice</strong></a> multiple times per day, and make sure to <a href="/news/how-to-meditate-regularly-en.html"><strong>be regular in your meditation practice.</strong></a></p>

<h6>3- Nothing else.</h6>
<p>Don't do anymore efforts than necessary. <strong>Make your life easier</strong>...you might even want to reduce your level of activity for now. Just make sure to do the two previous steps and that should help you out immensely. We all have a tendency to add activities to our lives and do too much things at a time.<strong> It is better to practice reduction of your depression than to fill your time with distractions in order to forget your problems.</strong></p>
