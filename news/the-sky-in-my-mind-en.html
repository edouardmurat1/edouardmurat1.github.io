                <p class="lead mb-0">“<em>If you want to see the sunshine, you have to weather the storm.</em>” - Frank Lane</p>

<p>When we look at our minds, lots of clouds with different shape and colors pass through it. When left on its own, our mind can turn into a nasty storm that becomes very difficult to calm. Thankfully, storms never last and clear up quite nicely under well guided observation. <strong>Let’s take some time today to look at the sky in our mind.</strong></p>

<h4>The storm is here and now</h4>

<p>As I wait in the car for someone, I can feel my impatience. I can see the sky in my mind getting darker, filling up with clouds. My mind is like a sky, when it becomes darker and more negative, I can see it through its clouds or... thoughts. Our thoughts are a good representation of how clouded our mind is. If my thoughts are fast and negative, then the rain might come soon...but if thoughts are rare and positive, then I know that the sunshine is here.</p>

<p><strong>Whether my mind is in an easy or difficult shape, it’s now and here that I can take a look at it, that I can appreciate it for what it is.</strong> And it is by looking at the sky in my mind that I can see that shadow and light are never lasting.</p>

<h4>Observe the sky</h4>

<p>As I observe my sky, I can see more clearly the shapes and colors that pass through it. Sometimes my sky has red clouds, made of anger and frustration. At other times, it has a dark blue tint, feeling a little depressed and despaired. But when the sky is clear and shiny, I see it as well and appreciate its beauty, warmth and comfort.</p>

<p><strong>When we observe our sky, we learn how it works</strong>, we learn how each and every thought, sensation and emotion present are not there to stay, only temporarily passing through so we can live them. Really, there is a lot of things going on in my sky when I close my eyes and look at my breath...so much in fact that it makes quite difficult for me to keep looking at my breath, patiently.</p>

<h4>Calm the storm</h4>

<p>At first, when the storm came into my mind... I could not see it until it was the size of a tornado. My mind had become cluttered by many negative thoughts and emotions, making it difficult to even comprehend what had happened to my sky. Too many shapes and colors for me to understand it, yet I felt the need to look at it, observe it...so I could learn from it.</p>

<p><strong>5 years later, with practice and patience... I can look at my sky and see its more subtle changes.</strong> When a red or dark blue cloud comes by, I see it and bring a little more light to it...making it easier for it to move along and clear up my sky.</p>

<p>There is nothing like observing your sky to clear it of all its rapid movements...and such joy from patiently clearing it one cloud at a time.</p>

<h4>Understand your sky</h4>

<p>Everyone has a different sky, but everyone can work patiently on clearing it. Depending on your life experience, your sky has taken a particular color and shape...and there is no one better than yourself to know what it looks like now. Yet, many before us have looked patiently at how their sky worked, how they could clear it up, and what lead to less or more clouds in it.</p>

<p><strong>The sky in our mind follows specific rules, just like our sky on earth</strong>... and taking the time to learn those rules is crucial, for there is a way to transform those clouds that cast a shadow into little suns that bring more light into our life.</p>

<p>While certain traits such as concentration, calm, and compassion help that transformation...it really depends on our curious observation of what is happening to our sky right now...it really depends on our mindfulness.</p>

<h4>Let’s clear it up</h4>

<p><strong>Here is a very simple activity that you can do to clear up your sky right now </strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Find a place where you are not likely to be interrupted</li>
  <li>Start a 10-minute timer</li>
  <li>Sit in a comfortable position with your eyes closed</li>
  <li>Look gently at your breath. When you breathe in, you know that you breathe in. When you breath out, you know that you breath out.</li>
  <li>Everytime you notice that your mind has wandered to something else, go back very gently to looking again at your breath</li>
</ul>

<p>After this exercise, you might notice that your sky has become clearer...less cluttered with dark and heavy clouds. With time, patience, and practice...hopefully your sky will turn into a very clear and shiny sky.</p>
