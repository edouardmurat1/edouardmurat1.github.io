<p>Despite what many people say, <strong>meditation is far from being an easy practice</strong> that does not require mental or physical effort. Meditation brings many benefits, yet they do not happen without perseverance. This article is dedicated to breaking the myth that meditation is easy <strong>to show you difficulties related to this practice.</strong></p>

<h4>DOUBTS AND LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN MEDITATION</h4>

<p>Many people are interested in meditation, but a great number of them drop this idea because of fears, doubts, and do not believe what meditators tell them. Having a calm and peaceful mind may seem impossible for a person having difficulty with their own emotions and thoughts, and yet it is possible.</p>

<p>After a young age, we stop believing blindly what others tell us...after all they can lie and be wrong. We then verify what has been said to us by asking questions to many other sources of knowledge. This same phenomenon is found among young meditators, they seek to verify if what they have been told is true by seeking a lot of different information about meditation...However this method of verification does not work well with meditation.</p>

<p><strong>Here is why :</strong> Meditation is an internal activity that is hardly visible externally, since it is mostly a practice of mental faculties such as attention, awareness, concentration, compassion, etc... To verify the kind of change that happens inside another human being is an extremely difficult task. It is complex and requires a lot of scientific equipment (example: brain imaging).</p>

<p><strong>A better way to verify</strong> what is said about meditation is actually to...<strong>try it directly within yourself</strong>. You must observe your own mental faculties to understand how they work and improve them over time. When a regular meditator looks at his mental state, he sees his thoughts, he sees his emotions and he sees that some thoughts bring negative emotions and that other thoughts bring positive emotions, for example.</p>

<p>However, for a young meditator, it is difficult to understand and see clearly how his thoughts, emotions and sensations work. To do this, one must first trust other meditators and practice often <strong>until he can witness changes in his own mental state.</strong></p>

<p>And yes, it is through the practice of meditation that the doubts and lack of confidence regarding this exercise diminish ... there is no escape from it.</p>

<h4>False Advertising</h4>

<p>Many people lie or omit information about the practice of meditation for a variety of reasons (power, money, authority, popularity, etc.) or simply not to displease their "customers". For example, a person may say that meditation is easy, requires little effort, brings positive emotions...without it being really the case. <strong>A lack of confidence in meditation increases</strong> as these lies are passed on. I have already myself transmitted incomplete information before, since I am learning meditation as I practice it every day.</p>

<p><strong>Meditation is not easy.</strong> To meditate is above all an effort to understand how one works internally, through techniques of relaxation, concentration and visualization. It requires discipline and perseverance, it is not a miracle solution that removes the difficulties and pains of life but rather transcends them through an intelligent and sustained effort.</p>

<h4>BELIEF THAT MEDITATION REMOVES PAIN OR DIFFICULTY</h4>

<p>The practice of meditation helps us go through difficulties and tough times more effectively, simply and with less suffering and resistance...but it does not necessarily remove the pain or difficulty involved.</p>

<p>If you have back pain and are meditating to help reduce your pain, <strong>meditation will help you observe your pain more distantly, without getting too attached to it...but also without making it disappear</strong>. Of course, before forming a new perspective of this pain, you will have to go through unpleasant sensations, emotions and thoughts.</p>

<h4>ASK, READ, LISTEN ... WITHOUT PRACTICING</h4>

<p>I mention often that the most important is to practice. <strong>Without formal sessions of meditation, how could we really progress ?</strong> You can read, listen to YouTube videos, talk to other people...without any sign of a big internal change.</p>

<p>In 5 years of daily meditation, I only read 2 books on that subject, and stop reading them for a long time now and here's why: Whenever I want to read them I say to myself "I'd better meditate rather than read, because practice is better" and then my desire to read decreases to leave room for my desire to meditate.</p>

<p>It's worth it ! To apply efforts to meditation practice becomes easier and easier, just move forward, fall, get up and keep walking...again and again.</p>

<h4>Our services</h4>

<p>At HeadPause, we hold a <a href="https://www.headpause.com/services/meditation-group-en.html"><strong>free meditation group</strong></a> every Friday, where you can share your difficulties and understand that you are not the only one.
