                <p class="lead mb-0">“<em>An ounce of practice is generally worth more than a ton of theory.</em>” - Ernst F. Schumacher</p>

<p>The practice of mindfulness is beautiful, challenging, and very meaningful...that is when it is practiced properly. Today, we are talking about <strong>what you should do to be more mindful, but also what traps you should avoid.</strong></p>

<h4>Keep at it</h4>

<p>When I started to practice mindfulness meditation, I was told here and there that I should keep on practicing...that I should keep at it even if I have doubts, questions, and wasn’t sure if I was doing it right. This “keep going advice” is the one I have found to be most useful, and that I recommend the most to beginners when they come meditate in our group.</p>

<p>In the same way, it is <strong>much much much much much much more important (yes, that much more) to practice every single day a little bit (10 min) then to go on long retreats every weekend.</strong> The benefits that come from daily mindfulness practice are what will help you keep at it and understand first-hand why it is critical to practice it for your own health and peace of mind.</p>

<h4>Difficulty is normal</h4>

<p>You become easily frustrated when you practice, have difficulty to concentrate, or find it hard to take 10 minutes a day to meditate...that’s normal. An overflow of thoughts, emotions and sensations can come to you when you practice...and that’s okay. Trust me, it will reduce with time and leave you with more peace inside afterwards.</p>

<p>The practice of mindfulness takes dedication, motivation, and a whole lot of discipline. It is not an easy practice for sure, but...<strong>the level of difficulty you face right now is probably at its highest.</strong> If you keep at it, it will just become easier and easier to practice even more and better...so hang in there.</p>

<p>That reminds me of a story from the movie “Catch Me If You Can” : “Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream. The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned. The second mouse, wouldn't quit. He struggled so hard that eventually he churned that cream into butter and crawled out.”</p>

<h4>Lose your phone</h4>

<p>My smartphone was my biggest enemy at the beginning. I would use it to escape from all the difficulties that existed in the present moment. That is probably why smartphones are so popular by the way...because they absorb us in a fast exciting world, making it extremely easy for us to forget the pain present inside of ourselves.</p>

<p>Smartphones are useful, but the truth is that we almost never use them to do anything meaningful for others. I’m not saying that you should stop using them all together...but do <strong>reduce greatly your use of smartphones to run away from the present moment.</strong></p>

<h4>Reading is not good practice</h4>

<p>I see more and more people nowadays that talk to me about books they read about meditation or mindfulness, and how they like certain authors, or how helpful they find those books to be...let me be as clear as possible.</p>

<p>Reading is a tool to help us visualize the rules at play as we practice mindfulness, in order to tweak our practice here and there, and shouldn’t be used to start the practice of mindfulness, unless you have no idea at all of how to start.</p>

<p><strong>If right now, you stop reading this sentence to start practicing...you got it ! That is all you need to do !</strong> You can read as much as you want....that is not good mindfulness practice. To be more mindful you have to practice and practice, and after that...practice some more.</p>

<p>If reading a book will motivate you to start practicing, I also think it is great, but what is almost always better than a book about mindfulness...is its formal practice.</p>

<h4>Practice...even badly</h4>

<p>I remember when I started to do breathing meditation. I would focus really really hard on my breath, use a lot of energy, become extremely frustrated. I was practicing very badly without the use of any teacher or book...by the way. But you know what, with each practice my mind and body learned on their own to calibrate and practice more beautifully. All I really did was hang in there for a long time, and now the result is very satisfying and calming.</p>

<p>There is no shortcut, no magical solution, no non-painful solution either...yes, the practice of mindfulness is a very direct and good way to transform your mind and improve your perspective on life, but it also comes with pain, difficulties, and challenges along the way. You don’t become a professional tennis player without scratching your knees at the beginning, and lose games now and then...<strong>you change yourself by continuing to practice after falling down...you become more mindful by going through mindless states at the beginning.</strong> As I once read: “It’s in the mud that grows a beautiful flower”, so don’t worry if you are still in the mud...it’s a necessary step.</p>

<h4>Our services</h4>

<p>At HeadPause, we organize a <a href="/services/meditation-group-en.html"><strong>free weekly meditation group</strong></a> each Friday, where you can practice with like-minded individuals. It is open to beginners and advanced mindful meditators, because the practice of mindfulness is mostly about how to live well with yourself among others. Also, don’t miss out our 2 hours <a href="/services/mindfulness-workshop-en.html"><strong>mindfulness workshop</strong></a> to introduce yourself to this practice and start your journey on a solid foot.</p>
