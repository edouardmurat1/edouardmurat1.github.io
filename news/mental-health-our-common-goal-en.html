                <span itemprop="articleBody"><h4>Mental problems on the rise</h4>

                <p>Many mental health issues are on the rise, we are now talking of <strong>over 450 million people worldwide</strong> having a mental health problem - more than 1 in every 16. Finally, it is considered to be one of the biggest burdens that our planet is facing, among wars and climate change.</p>

                <p>When we look deeper into the statistics, we find that <strong>75% of all mental disorders start before the age of 25</strong>. Children and adolescents have the highest risk of being subject to mental issues yet public awareness of mental problems is still lacking greatly. Globally, we see that <strong>20% of children and adolescents have mental disorders or problems.</strong></p>

                <p>We hear more talks on depression, stress, mood disorders, and personality disorders, but a great deal of efforts remain.</p>

                <p><strong>Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide</strong>, with 5 to 10 % of the population suffering from it at any given time, and will be the <strong>single biggest medical burden on healthcare by 2020.</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Stress rises steadily</strong>, with over 75% of american adults experiencing moderate to high levels of stress in the past month and 40% feeling more stressed than last year.</p>

                <p>While wealthy countries have more resources toward mental illness, we can still see that <strong>in canada, 1/3 receive mental health services</strong> that they really need. And <strong>every year, 1 in 5 Canadians experiences mental problems or issues related to addiction.</strong></p>


                <h4>Outdated solutions</h4>

                <p>While it is true that mental illnesses were not closely looked at for a very long time, and that psychological services are newly popular, that doesn’t quite explain <strong>why mental problems are rising.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Our lifestyles are part of the problem</strong>. We go from one activity to another without giving ourselves any rest, and fall into the traps of our modern life, moving dangerously faster.</p>

                <p><strong>Another part of the problem, is the solution</strong>. Psychological services have existed for quite a long time, but were rarely holistic in their approaches.</p>

                <p>In one generation, psychologist were <strong>only interested in behavior</strong>, people’s external actions and ways of living, while considering thoughts as useless and a black box that should not be explored.</p>

                <p>Later on, psychologists would <strong>focus solely on thoughts</strong> or cognition, what we think, how it influences us, and how it can benefit us to change are old thinking patterns. But yet again, extremist views on cognition lead people to shut down most study on behavior.</p>

                <p><strong>In our generation</strong>, people focus on feeling better, doing exercise, yoga, eating healthy….taking time to <strong>focus on their present sensations and emotions</strong> while doing something beneficial for their body. We fell again in an extremism, where people focus less on thoughts / behaviorism and more on their direct sensations and emotions.</p>

                <p><strong>But none of those approaches quite fix our mental problems!</strong></p>


                <h4>Use the right approach</h4>

                <p>Our mind is directly affected by <strong>sensations, emotions, thoughts, and behaviors</strong>. Each of those processes is important on their own, but they also all rely on each other.</p>

                <p><strong>A solution to mental problems</strong> therefore requires a tool that will <strong>treat all of those 4 areas</strong>, in order for it to be right on the target and to be useful for many individuals.</p>

                <p>While we all are a bit different, the rules that govern our general mental health are the same. <strong>As for any science</strong> - medicine, biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics -  when we understand those general rules, the solutions that flourish from them can <strong>change greatly our way of life.</strong></p>

          
                <h4>New solution</h4>

                <p><strong>Meditation leads to changes in sensation, emotion, thought, and behavior</strong> to anyone who practices it. It helps people be more in tune with their <strong>bodies</strong>, feel and accept more their <strong>emotions</strong>, understand and transform their <strong>cognition</strong>, and positively change their <strong>behavior.</strong></p>

                <p>It has been and continues to be scientifically verified has <strong>a psychological approach that works</strong>. Results are coming in every day to confirm the hypothesis that <strong>meditation helps many mental problems</strong>, whether it is related to stress, depression, mood disorders, personality disorders, relationship problems, chronic pain, aging, sleep issues, attention deficits, and much more.</p>

                <p>Not only does it help overcome mental problems, it is a <strong>very affordable and scalable solution</strong> for anyone to use. Meditation requires almost no resources in terms of money and time, it is even said that <strong>only 10 minutes of daily meditation</strong> are enough for a person to see clear changes in mental health conditions.</p></span>
